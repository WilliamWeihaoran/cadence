# Services Guide

This folder contains shared app services and persistence-adjacent support. It includes migration/repair code, markdown/note support, AI provider support, schema declarations, and read-only integration support.

## Boundaries

- `CadenceSchema.swift` is the canonical schema list. Update it only with matching model intent.
- `PersistenceController.swift` is legacy/compatibility support; SwiftData is the primary persistence path.
- Migration and repair services should be deterministic, idempotent, and conservative.
- Markdown/note services should avoid blocking UI flows and should prefer structured parsing/helpers over ad hoc string edits when possible.
- `MCPReadOnly/` is integration-facing. Do not edit it unless the task explicitly asks for MCP/read-only API work.

## Risk Notes

- Deletion and repair flows can trigger SwiftData/CoreData fault crashes if stale relationships are touched after a model is deleted.
- Calendar/task/note references may store external identifiers; handle missing targets gracefully.
- AI provider settings are user configuration. Avoid logging secrets or persisting transient request data.

## Verification

Run the macOS build after touching shared services. Add focused tests if changing migration, deletion, or parsing behavior.
